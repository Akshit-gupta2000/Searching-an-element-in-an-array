# Searching-an-element-in-an-array
# Linear-search
Linear search is a searching algorithm which is used to detect the presence of a number in an array and if present, it locates its position in that array.This algorithm compares each element of the array with the search query comparing every element until the number is found and located.
# Binary-search
Binary search in C programming locates the middle element of the array and compares the search value.If they are equal, it displays the subscript of that element, otherwise, the search is reduced to one-half.If the search value is less than middle value of the array, the first half is searched, otherwise, the second half is searched.This continues until the search value is equal to the middle value of the array or until the search value is not found.
